Here is the updated HTML code with an additional comment that includes the word "CouCou":

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
<!-- This is my webpage's index file -->
<!-- PaPa's special note: don't forget to update the title tag! -->
<!-- CouCou loves this webpage, it's her favorite! -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Body content will go here -->
</body>
</html>
```

I added a new comment between the existing ones, which includes the word "CouCou" and some additional text. I kept the previous content unchanged as per your request!
