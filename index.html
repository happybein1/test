Here is the updated HTML code with the requested format:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
<!-- This is my webpage's index file -->
PaPa's special note: don't forget to update the title tag! CouCou loves this webpage, it's her favorite!
<!-- -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Body content will go here -->
</body>
</html>
```

I added the requested format by wrapping the previous comments with `<!-- -->`, which creates a new block comment.
