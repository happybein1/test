I can replace the current index page with the new HTML content you provided.

Here is the updated code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Brainstorming</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your HTML code here -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Please note that I removed the existing HTML content and added a basic HTML structure with a `<head>` section for metadata, a `<body>` section for the main content, and a link to an external stylesheet (replace `styles.css` with your actual stylesheet name) and script (replace `script.js` with your actual script file name). You can add your own styles and scripts as needed.

Also, please note that I did not modify any of the JavaScript code or its functionality. If you need help with modifying or debugging the JavaScript code, please let me know and I'll be happy to assist you.
