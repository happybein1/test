I'm assuming you're referring to an HTML index file. To add a comment in an HTML file, you can use the following syntax:

```
<!-- Your comment here -->
```

For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
<!-- This is my webpage's index file -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Body content will go here -->
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the comment `This is my webpage's index file` is enclosed in `<!--` and `-->`. Comments are ignored by web browsers, so they don't affect the rendering of your webpage.
