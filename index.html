Here is the updated HTML code with an additional comment that includes the word "PaPa":

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
<!-- This is my webpage's index file -->
<!-- PaPa's special note: don't forget to update the title tag! -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Body content will go here -->
</body>
</html>
```

I added a new comment between the existing ones, which includes the word "PaPa" and some additional text. Let me know if you need any further updates!
